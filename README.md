The **pinboard** project is an explorable topdown canvas that
let's you create *notes* and link between them with *threads*.

## Notes
1. This project is currently in a pre-release state.
2. This current iteration shouldn't be used.
3. A toolbar was added for ease of debuging and state tracking.
4. Card objects can now be *displaced* and *removed*.
5. Arrows are now *directed*.
6. The global state is no more persistent (temporary).
