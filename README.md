The **pinboard** project is an explorable topdown canvas that
let's you create *notes* and link between them with *threads*.

## Notes
1. This project is currently in a pre-release state, use at own discretion.
2. By holding the mouse wheel down you can pan, by spinning it you can zoom in and out.
3. Global state is saved.
